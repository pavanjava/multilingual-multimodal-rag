This image illustrates a pipeline for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. Data engineers process web documents, database records, and internal documents through a CDC (Change Data Capture) pipeline into the LlamaIndex-Qdrant Indexer, which saves indexes into MLflow for tracking and evaluation. Users interact with the RAG-Bot that uses the LlamaIndex-Qdrant retriever to fetch data from the indexed information for their queries.
